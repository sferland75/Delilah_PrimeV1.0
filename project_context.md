# Delilah Prime - Project Context

## Project Overview

Delilah Prime is a secure clinical report generation system designed to transform occupational therapy assessment notes into structured professional reports while protecting patient confidentiality. The system leverages AI assistance (Claude Opus API) for narrative enhancement without exposing protected health information (PHI), targeting occupational therapists and other clinicians in medico-legal contexts.

## Problem Statement

Clinical professionals spend significant time converting assessment notes into formal reports. This process is:
- Time-consuming (up to 3-4 hours per assessment)
- Subject to inconsistency in quality and format
- Potentially exposing PHI when using external AI tools for assistance
- Challenging to maintain clinical accuracy while improving narrative flow

Delilah Prime solves these problems by:
1. Providing a secure pipeline for de-identifying PHI before AI processing
2. Standardizing report structure and language
3. Automating narrative generation while maintaining clinical accuracy
4. Securely re-identifying content in the final report
5. Offering a user-friendly web interface for managing the entire workflow

## Core Workflows

### 1. Enhanced Document Processing Pipeline

```
Document Review → Assessment → Note Collection → De-identification → AI Enhancement → Report Refinement → Word Export
```

- **Input**: Assessment notes, file review, supporting medical documents
- **Processing**: Section extraction, de-identification, AI enhancement, interactive refinement
- **Output**: Professional clinical report in both text and Word format

### 2. De-identification Approach

- Advanced pattern-based recognition of common PHI (names, dates, addresses, healthcare providers, etc.)
- Replacement with unique placeholders and consistent reference table
- Secure local storage of reference mappings
- Interactive reference table viewer for validation
- No PHI transmitted to external systems

### 3. Report Structure 

Standard sections include:
- Case Synopsis
- Background Information
- Assessment Methodology
- Functional Observations
- Activities of Daily Living
- Social Functioning
- Concentration, Persistence & Pace
- Adaptability in Work Settings
- Summary & Recommendations

## Technical Architecture

   - Environment variable configuration
   - Rate-limit handling and retry logic

## Current Status

Version 1.1 implemented with:
- Complete web-based workflow for OT report generation
- Advanced de-identification with comprehensive pattern matching
- Document processors for multiple file formats (Word, PDF, text)
- Section-based report organization and refinement
- Claude API integration with enhanced rate-limiting protection
- Word document export with proper formatting
- Administrator tools for customizing prompts
- Offline mode for working without API access
- Response caching system for improved performance
- Thread-safe section processing with concurrency protection
- Improved chunk processing with sequential handling
- Real-time activity console with detailed status updates

## Recent Improvements (v1.1)

1. **Enhanced API Handling**
   - Intelligent response caching to avoid redundant API calls
   - Thread-safe processing to prevent duplicate work
   - Reduced rate-limiting wait times (from 30s to 10s)
   - Improved error handling with automatic retries
   - Optimized content chunking for large documents

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Sequential chunk processing to maintain order
   - Better logging with status indicators and timestamps
   - Significantly reduced processing time for repeated content
   - Memory usage improvements for large documents

3. **User Experience**
   - Real-time activity console with detailed status updates
   - Better error handling and user notifications
   - Smoother template and report management

4. **Reliability Enhancements**
   - More robust error handling throughout the application
   - Fixed concurrency issues with parallel processing
   - Improved file handling for different document types
   - Better session management for report generation

## Example Use Case

An occupational therapist conducts a functional assessment and follows this workflow:

1. **Pre-Assessment**: Review referral documents and medical records
2. **Assessment**: Complete evaluation and take notes in structured sections
3. **Document Processing**: Upload notes and collateral documents to Delilah Prime
4. **Initial Processing**: System de-identifies, organizes by section, and enhances content
5. **Report Refinement**: OT reviews draft, refines sections with AI assistance
6. **Finalization**: System reidentifies content and exports professional Word document
7. **Review**: OT reviews final document before submission

## Technical Considerations

- Offline mode implemented to handle API rate limits and work without connectivity
- Enhanced chunk processing to handle large documents while respecting API limits
- Word document export with proper clinical formatting
- Customizable prompts for domain-specific terminology and reporting styles
- Environment variables for configuration without code changes
- Response caching for improved performance and reduced API costs
- Thread-safe processing for better reliability

## Long-term Roadmap

1. **Expansion to Other Clinical Specialties**:
   - Physical therapy report templates
   - Neuropsychology assessment formats
   - Speech-language pathology documentation

2. **Enhanced AI Capabilities**:
   - Template-guided section generation
   - Consistency checking across report sections
   - Terminology standardization

3. **Workflow Improvements**:
   - User account management
